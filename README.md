This project implements a search microservice for an e-commerce platform using FastAPI. It features a weighted scoring algorithm that ranks products by balancing price sensitivity (for "Sasta" queries) against ratings and stock availability. The service includes fuzzy matching to handle spelling mistakes and intent mapping for Hinglish queries to ensure relevant results for Tier-2 and Tier-3 city users.# GLP-Tech-Assign
